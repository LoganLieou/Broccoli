## Euclids Algorithm

Euclids algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers, for example if we took the values 7 and 14 their gcd would be 7, if you took the values 99 and 100 their gcd would be 1, as there are no common factors for which these values are divisible by, all whole integer values are divisible by 1 therefore both 100 and 99 are divisible by 1.
